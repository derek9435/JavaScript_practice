# JavaScript_practice
javascript libary usage done one year before

This program, project-07-hello.html, is using the javascript libraary, Processsing.js, to do
simple pen drawing

## How It works
Open the file, project-07-hello.html, in a browser, then move the mouse cursor into the shaded window panel.
As the mouse cursor moves, the dot skteching traces display.

## Languages
html and the javascript library, Processing.js, are used. The javascript function, setup(), defines the window 
panel size; the functio, draw(), define the drawing funcionality , which responds to the mouse cursor's movement
to do drawing/skecthing.
